1. Make it save data for all 12 months.
2. Add a yearly calendar to check your consistency with any habit over months.
3. Adding notes to link your efforts over a period for a project.
4. readme file should be a numbered list, explaining the code line by line, like chatgpt does for you.
5. allow user to add new habit entry with a button and a shortcut(like Ctrl+N), and on hovering over the button display the shortcut.
6. give it a cooler design.
7. accounts for users, and store user data remotely(online).
8. integrate atomic habits methodology into it.
9. Error Handling: Consider adding more robust error handling to manage unexpected scenarios gracefully.
10. User Experience: You can enhance the UI by adding features like dynamic habit addition, progress tracking, or visual summaries.
11. Data Persistence: Ensure that your application correctly handles scenarios like empty files or corrupted data to prevent crashes.

DONE.Add a readme file explaining the program.

                entry_data, checkbox_data = line.split(';', 1)
                entry.insert(0, entry_data)
                checkbox_states = checkbox_data.split(',')
